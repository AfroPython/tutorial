# AfroPython Tutorial

This tutorial is based on the [original tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/pt/) available at Django Girls page. It was originally written in Brazilian Portuguese and is currently being translated into English.
The original tutorial can be divided into two parts: preparing the environment and working directly with coding and Python. However,the installation of programs - the first part of the tutorial - was hard and there were usually a lot of errors involved. So, in recent events, we have chosen to use Codeanywhere (you will read more about it in the next chapter!). Because of that, the tutorial had to be slightly adapted, and unnecessary or messy parts were removed from it. 
Don't worry, the goal is still the same! You will leave the workshop with your blog online and a great intro into the world of programming!
