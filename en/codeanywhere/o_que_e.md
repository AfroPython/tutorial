# What is Codeanywhere?

Codeanywhere offers us a computer like any other, so we can develop our code. The thing is, when you use it, you can choose which operating system you're going to use and some resources already are installed (for instance, Python itself). Besides that, as we're going to be developing our website in a ** remote ** computer, when you leave AfroPython workshop, you can access your code from any other computer connected to the internet and you can continue working on it.
